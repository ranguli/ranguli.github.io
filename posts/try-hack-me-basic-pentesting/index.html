			<h1>TryHackMe Writeup - Basic Pentesting</h1>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my writeup for the <em>Basic Pentesting</em> challege on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackme</a>. This challenge provides multiple &lsquo;checkpoints&rsquo; with hand-holding hints that are often dead giveaways to ensure that you&rsquo;re on the right track and that you can make it through the challenge in order to absorb all of the knowledge. It&rsquo;s much more about testing your basic proficiency with tools, <em>not</em> about testing your guessing skills, or how you fair left to your own devices.</p>

<h3 id="1-find-the-services-exposed-by-the-machine">#1 Find the services exposed by the machine</h3>

<p>There are quite a number of services running on this machine, including <code>apache</code>, <code>smb</code>, <code>ssh</code>, and <code>tomcat</code> among others. The only ones that were really relevant are the first three.</p>

<p>A simple nmap scan enumerates the following services:</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-hidden-directory-on-the-web-server">Finding the hidden directory on the web server</h3>

<p>The next checkpoint asks us to find a hidden directory on the webserver. The hint straight up tells us to use a directory bruteforcer/scanner to find it. I personally like <code>gobuster</code>, with the <code>directory-list-2.3-big.txt</code> wordlist from the <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> repo.</p>

<pre><code>gobuster -w ~/projects/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-big.txt -u 10.10.95.50

Progress: 1159 / 1273834 (0.09%)
</code></pre>

<p>Right off the bat we got <code>development/</code>, which is the hidden directory we were tasked with finding.</p>

<p>We find two text files, the one that was the most interesting to me was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For J:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been auditing the contents of /etc/shadow to make sure we don&rsquo;t have any weak credentials,
and I was able to crack your hash really easily. You know our password policy, so please follow
it? Change that password ASAP.</p>

<p>-K</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we know that there&rsquo;s a user, <em>j</em>, with an easily crackable password. This is not their real username however, just an initial.</p>

<h3 id="use-brute-forcing-to-find-the-username-and-password">Use brute-forcing to find the username and password</h3>

<p>One of the services we enumerated was SMB, so we can start there by enumerating users and looking for someone with a name starting with the letter j. I ran into so much trouble with various SMB enumeration tools that I forgot to record which tool I used and the corresponding output for the writeup. We got the users though, and that&rsquo;s what matters.</p>

<h2 id="get-the-username">Get the username</h2>

<p>The users found during the SMB enumeration were <code>jan</code> and <code>kay</code>, these are <em>j</em>
and <em>k</em> we found earlier in the messages.</p>

<h2 id="get-the-password">Get the password</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re now told to get the password. Let&rsquo;s start by SSH bruteforcing <code>jan</code> first with the <code>rockyou.txt</code> wordlist.</p>

<pre><code>hydra -l jay -P rockyou.txt 10.10.95.50-t 4 ssh -V -f
</code></pre>

<p>We get back a successful match, <code>armando</code>, as our password.</p>

<h2 id="enumerate-the-machine-and-find-vectors-for-privilege-escalation">Enumerate the machine and find vectors for privilege escalation</h2>

<p>We can try logging into SSH with <code>jan@10.10.95.50</code>, and use <code>LinEnum</code> for finding vectors for privilege escalation. Because we don&rsquo;t have permission to create files in our home directory, I run the script from the <code>tmp/</code> directory. The script tells us that the <code>kay</code> user has admin permissions, and they own their own home directory. The script also tell us that <code>/usr/bin/vim.basic</code> has SUID permissions. From here I opened <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/shadow</code> with <code>/usr/bin/vim.basic</code>, transferred them to my machine, ran <code>unshadow</code> and started bruteforcing the credentials. This would prove unnecessary however, as the <code>kay</code> user has an SSH keypair in their home directory under <code>~/.ssh</code>. After exfiltrating them, I couldn&rsquo;t use them to SSH as the <code>kay</code> user because the private key has a passphrase, and I ran into a ton of difficulty getting <code>john</code> to crack the passphrase.</p>

<h2 id="get-the-flag">Get the flag</h2>

<p>At this point I simply realized I had been taking the long way around, because I also had access to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, I could just generate a new keypair on my host machine and copy the public key into <code>authorized_keys</code>, giving me SSH access into the box. In <code>~/kay</code> there&rsquo;s a file containing the password in plaintext, which is our final flag.</p>
